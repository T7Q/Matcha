## Authors

**Tatiana** - _Back/Front_ - [check her profile](https://github.com/T7Q)

**Diana** - _Back/Front_ - [check her profile](https://github.com/DianaMukaliyeva)

## Task

The aim of this project is to build a **Tinder-like web app**, where the users can create their profile, browse through a list of recommended profiles or conduct a search by age, distance, fame rating, commong tags. Users can like, report and block other users and chat with users that liked them back.

**Project constraints:**

- Clientside: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Relational or graph-oriented database
- Micro-frameworks and UI libraries are allowed
- No ORM, validators, or User Account Manager
- No errors, warnings or notice on both server- and client- sides
- No security breaches (e.g. no SQL, HTML injections, plain passwords in the database)
- Compatible at least with Firefox (>=41) and Chrome (>= 46)
- Responsive design

## Stack

This is the first project in Hive Helsinki web branch when we were allowed to choose the language.

Our team decided to use this opportunity to learn **PERN stack**. This was the first time for both of us to use PostgreSQL, React, Redux, and also JWT, Material UI and Socket.io. We also used this project to learn more about Node.js projects structures (including folder structure, configuring env variables and MVC pattern).

- **PostgreSQL**
- **Express**
- **React, Redux**
- **Node**
- JWT
- Material UI
- Socket.io

## Functionality

- **User features:**
  - Step-by-step registration, login (Oauth), and password reset through email link.
  - User data management, incl. edit profile data, change password and geolocation.
  - View own and other user profiles.
  - View profile visit history, list of connected and blocked profiles.
- **Matching features:**
  - Multiple infinite scroll galleries with a list of suggestions that match his/her profile (recommended, online, popular, nearby).
  - Matching Alogrimth using scoring weights based on Chinese and Western horoscope compatibility, common tags, fame rating, location, age and gender.
  - Advanced range sliders to sort and filter users by horoscope believe, common tags, location, fame rating and age.
- **Chat features:**
  - FB messenger-like real-time chat for connected users.
- **Notifications features:**
  - Real-time push notifications when the user receives a like/unlike, message from another user or user's profile is checked.

## Planning

### Work breakdown including time tracking

**Tatiana** planned work breakdown, her focus was on developing matching algorithm, user profile creation and interactions (likes, visits, blocked). Tatiana was the driving force behind UX/UI design of the app. [Tatiana's timetracking](https://github.com/T7Q/Matcha/blob/assets/timetracking_tatiana_kuumola.pdf)

**Diana** focus was on user features (inc. account creation, authentication, profile data management), real-time chat and notifications. Diana was the driving force behind the app architecture. [Diana's timetracking](https://github.com/T7Q/Matcha/blob/assets/timetracking_diana_mukaliyeva.pdf)
